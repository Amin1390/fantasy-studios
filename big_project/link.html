    <h1 id="ttl">how was new episode of jujutsu kaisen?</h1>
    <p>new episode of my favorite anime jujutsu kaisen was fine but it had some problems that i will tell you them to watch carefully this awesome anime
        at first I should start with choso an yuji fight.this fight included lot of textures and beuty but It was boring at some point because choso cursed
        energy was not unbeliveble becuase he is a user of blood cursed energy and another reason is that yuji is smart at fighting but not strong enough!
        ok ok lets see how was mei mei fight!In my opinion It was better than Yuji's fight but we didn't have any info about that cursed soul!
        and at the end I should say our last hope for continue of this fight is Sukuna because we saw him that was controling choso's mind!
        score of this Episode:6
