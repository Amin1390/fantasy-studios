    <h1>Episode 14</h1>
    <p>ok ok.this new episode was awesome.in previous react I said that choso's and Yuji's fight was boring and it is finished.This new episode with Mei Mei and zenin Drunk Grandmaster,Nanami kento and Maki zenin was grrat.let's start with Mei Mei fight.in previous episode we saw that a powerful cursed soul that was killing Mei Mei but then we understand that Mei Mei is not weak.she killed that poweful cursed soul in this episode(with his brother's help).and another fight.the only thing I can say about it is unbeliveble.why?because It was awesome.we saw that how zenin's Grand master is strong and why he is a grandmaster.and maki zenin.I don't like her I mean at the first episodes she was okay and her duel with mai zenin was great but now we saw that she is not enough strong against cursed special souls.Nanami,I love him.he is great I mean he is sexy,strong and powerful.I shuld add something about zenin's grand master power.we know that he can build some frames of himself in time but at the first I was confused.whyy?because he was explaining it like a univercity masters.that cursed soul wasn't introdused before but he was great because he was chalenging our heroes with new power.and at the end we surprised 2 times.first when megomi came and then great mr Yuta returns.score of this Episode:8</Episode:8></p>
