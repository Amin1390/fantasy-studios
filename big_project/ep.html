    <h1>Episode 15</h1>
    <p>ok ok this episode.how can I explain it?It was great.in continue of last react I said that yuta returns!but now we get that it was Toji.He showed us his power befre when he killed gojo saturo.but now he put a shit on that curse.that nfight was great.and about Nanami and Maki's death , I should say they are still alive.and great Sukuna's return was awesome.from myself , I should say I scaref of him when he was killing that two annowing girl.I have no idea about next episode but I can say 99% Sukuna is going to kill Jogo.score of this episode:8.5</p>
